# What is this app?
This app is a university project that presents general information  about breast cancer
as well as providing a model to measure a woman\'s risk of having it.
According to data gathered by the University Hospital Centre of Coimbra there are 10 predictors, all quantitative,
indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer. Using WEKA, we have isolated four of those predictors  and we managed to create a classification model that can
potentially be used as a biomarker of breast cancer for women.\n\n
While it is unlikely that a regular user will have access to the necessary information needed
by the model we are still providing it for anyone who does.
